# Finance
Collection of information and snippets about personal finance and beyond.  

## Table of Contents
TOC goes here, when I can figure out how to generate it.

## Introduction
These days finding information is not difficult, Google has given us that. The new issue is what information do you need? If you don't know what you need to know, it doesn't matter how easy it is to find. The aim of this "site" is to answer that for you: **What do you need to know about personal finance?**

What is the first step?  
Congratulations! You've already taken the first step by wanting to learn and seeking out information. I am glad you found your way here. I hope the information and links contain herein are helpful. 

What is the next step?  
There are varied opinions on that. If you want to keep your momentum going, take a look at Scott Adams' advice in the first link. Otherwise I would suggest you read everything and anything about personal finance. **Educate thyself!!**
