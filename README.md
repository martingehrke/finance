# Finance
Collection of information and snippets about personal finance and beyond.  

These days finding information is not difficult, Google has given us that. The new issue is what information do you need? If you don't know what you need to know, it doesn't matter how easy it is to find. The aim of this "site" is to answer that for you.  

**What do you need to know about personal finance?**

## [Main](https://github.com/martingehrke/finance/blob/master/main.md)
This is where all the info is for now, eventually it may split out to separate pages. For now this has books and other resources.


## [Proverbs](https://github.com/martingehrke/finance/blob/master/proverbs.md)
Neat little sayings you can print and hang up for motivation. I need to figure out a way to make that easy.  

## [They said it better](https://github.com/martingehrke/finance/blob/master/said.md)
I am certainly not a wordsmith, so someone else has always said it better.
