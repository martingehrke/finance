# Behavior
We have met the enemy and he is us. Conquering your behavior is a must for the successful investor.  

**READ** [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://smile.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman) by the Noble Prize winner Daniel Kahneman. It will come up again and again as you read about Behavioral Finance. 

## Dunning-Kruger effect
>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which relatively unskilled persons suffer illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
~  
>...people fail to adequately assess their level of competence — or specifically, their incompetence — at a task and thus consider themselves much more competent than everyone else. This lack of awareness is attributed to their lower level of competence robbing them of the ability to critically analyse their performance, leading to a significant overestimate of themselves.

This applies to personal finance like everything else. You are not as smart as you think you are. The way to counter this is to have someone to talk to about all of this. Sharing personal financial information should not be done lightly, but can be necessary. Choose wisely.
