## Unified Theory of Everything Financial by Scott Adams
from [Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel](http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006052149X/dogberrypatch-20)

1. Make a will  
2. Pay off your credit cards  
3. Get term life insurance if you have a family to support  
4. Fund your 401k to the maximum  
5. Fund your IRA to the maximum  
6. Buy a house if you want to live in a house and can afford it  
7. Put six months worth of expenses in a money-market account  
8. Take whatever money is left over and invest 70% in a stock index fund and 30% in a bond fund through any discount broker and never touch it until retirement  

Some claim Adams deserves a Nobel Price in economics for this.

## Warren Buffet
Mr. Buffet probably deserves his own page, until then...  
**On Earnings**: “Never depend on single income. Make investments to create a second source.”  
**On Spending**: “If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.”  
**On Savings**: “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.”  
**On Taking Risks**: “Never test the depth of a river with both feet.”  
**On Investments**: “Do not put all your eggs in one basket.”  
**On Expectations**: “Honesty is a very expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people.”
