## Unified Theory of Everything Financial by Scott Adams
from [Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel](http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006052149X/dogberrypatch-20)

1. Make a will  
2. Pay off your credit cards  
3. Get term life insurance if you have a family to support  
4. Fund your 401k to the maximum  
5. Fund your IRA to the maximum  
6. Buy a house if you want to live in a house and can afford it  
7. Put six months worth of expenses in a money-market account  
8. Take whatever money is left over and invest 70% in a stock index fund and 30% in a bond fund through any discount broker and never touch it until retirement  

**Commentary**  
Some claim Adams deserves a Nobel Price in economics for this. I would order things a bit differently:  
7. Put enough in an emergency fund to cover any unexpected expenses.  
2. Pay off your credit cards. There are many ways to do this but only a few make sense to me. Use the [debt snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-snowball_method) or pay the highest interest first (AKA [debt avalanche](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=debt%20avalanche)).  
4. Invest up to the company match in your 401k if you have one, if you don't, skip this for now.  
7. Now go back and squirrel away six months of expenses in a CD ladder or something safe.  
4. Now, max out your 401k  
5. Max out your IRA  
The rest can be done simultaneously.  

## Warren Buffet
Mr. Buffet probably deserves his own page, until then...  
**On Earnings**: “Never depend on single income. Make investments to create a second source.”  
**On Spending**: “If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.”  
**On Savings**: “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.”  
**On Taking Risks**: “Never test the depth of a river with both feet.”  
**On Investments**: “Do not put all your eggs in one basket.”  
**On Expectations**: “Honesty is a very expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people.”
