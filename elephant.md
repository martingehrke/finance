# The Elephant in the Room
There are ample resources on the internet to education even the most financially ignorant person. Then why do we still have a financial literacy problem? 

## If they only taught Financial literacy in school...  
I can't tell you that I would have been better off having received financial education in high school. Would I have paid attention? Would I have realized the step up it could have provided me? Perhaps. I wish my younger self would. 

> Give a man a fish and feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for life. --ridiculously old adage
  
The missing part of the above is that the man must want to better himself. It seems self-evident that the man would want to escape his daily hunger problem. Unfortunately that isn't always the case, for uncountable reasons.

## The Financial Education Fallacy
>Objective observers generally admit that research to date does not demonstrate a causal chain
from financial education to higher financial literacy to better financial behavior to improved
financial outcomes (Shawn Cole and Gauri Kartini Shastry 2008; Ian Hathaway and Sameer
Khatiwada 2008; Lauren E. Willis 2009; William G. Gale and Ruth Levine 2010), in part due to
biases, heuristics, and other nonrational influences on financial decisions. Yet the search for
effective financial education continues. [The Financial Education Fallacy](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eL1lVnAW8N0J:https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2011conference/program/retrieve.php%3Fpdfid%3D565+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)
