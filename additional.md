# Additional Unsolicited Advice
This is just a place for un-categorized advice. 

## Pay yourself first
Fine, I certainly didn't say this first, but I don't think we know who did. Regardless.  
Instead of paying all your bills, and then saving the leftovers. Pay yourself first but transferring that money to a dedicated savings account. This will end up forcing you to know how much you pay in bills. See [managing working capital](#managing-working-capital)

## If you aren't paying for it, you are the product
This is especially pertinent for online services. Take facebook. Facebook is free, but the company still manages to make money. How? Because they are selling you. You are the product they sell to advetisers and other businesses.  

## Switch to a Credit Union
Banks are businesses and have shareholders or owners. Credit Unions by law are owned by the members. By opening an account at a credit union, you are becoming a shareholder with voting rights. See <http://www.asmarterchoice.org/> for more quantitative reasoning.  

## Prepare Monthly/Yearly Financial Reports
You can't know how to get to your financial goals if you don't know where you are starting. 
Create a template for monthly and/or yearly financial reports. Here are some basic questions you should be able to answer.  
1. What is your net worth?  
2. How much did you make last month/year? before & after taxes  
3. How much did you spend last month/year?  
4. What are your top 10 expenses?  
5. How much did you pay in taxes?  
6. What is your savings rate?  
7. Where is your money? break it down into types of accounts (retirement, cash, 529, non-retirement, real estate)  
[How Do I Money](http://howdoimoney.com/can-answer-ten-easiest-money-questions-ever/) has a very similar list of financial questions to which you should alwasys know the answer.

## Fight Lifestyle Inflation
This will also help prepare you for a reduction in income.  
Make yourself a list of re-occuring monthly and yearly expenses. Are all those expenses mandatory? The bi-weekly maid service is lifestyle inflation. Do you really need the latest iPhone every year?  
Say you get a nice raise (beyond a cost of living increase). Take the difference between your old and new paycheck and automatically save it. Transfer it to a different account. Act like you never got a raise, save it all.
