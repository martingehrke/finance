## Economic Outpatient Care
From: The Millionaire Next Door
>Economic Outpatient Care (EOC) is a term used to express when an affluent parent provides money to an adult child. [1](#citations)

## Under/Average/Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth
From: The Millionaire Next Door
>Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW) is a name coined by the authors used to represent individuals who have a low net wealth compared to their income.[1](#citations)   
>The authors define an Average Accumulator of Wealth (AAW) as having a net worth equal to one-tenth their age multiplied by their current annual income from all sources.[1](#citations)   
> Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAW) is the reciprocal of the more common UAW, accumulating usually well over the product of the individualâ€™s age and one tenth of his/her realized pretax income and are usually considered to be millionaires; however, not all are.[1](#citations) 

## Big Hat, No Cattle
From: The Millionaire Next Door
>We first heard this expression from a thirty-five-year-old Texan. He owned a very successful business that rebuilt large diesel engines. But he drove a ten-year-old car and wore jeans and a buckskin shirt. He lived in a modest house in a lower-middle-class area. His neighbors were postal clerks, firemen, and mechanics.  
After he substantiated his financial success with actual numbers, this Texan told us:  
[My] business does not look pretty. I don't play the part . . . don't act it.... When my British partners first met me, they thought I was one of our truck drivers.... They looked all over my office, looked at everyone but me. Then the senior guy of the group said, "Oh, we forgot we were in Texas!" I don't own big hats, but I have a lot of cattle. [3](#citations)  
  
Definition: Full of big talk but lacking action, power, or substance; pretentious[2](#citations)

## Personal Savings Rate
The Financial Independence sub-reddit has a decent [short intro](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_calculate_my_savings_rate.3F). But the idea really is that they more you save, the sooner you can retire. Mr. Money Mustache does a great job of explaining it: [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/).  

## Lifestyle Inflation
>Increasing your spending when your income goes up.[4](#citations)

## Sunk Cost Fallacy
> Sunk costs are expenses which cannot be recovered once they have been incurred. An example of sunk cost would be advertising expenses -- once a company pays for such an expense, there is no way undo it. Decision theory suggests that sunk costs should not be taken into account while making a decision. [5](#citations)

## FI/RE
FI/RE stand for Financial Independence/Early Retirement. FI/ER doesn't look as cool as FI/RE. I guess it could be Retire Early.   
>It is typically defined as having enough income (from investments, passive businesses, real estate, etc) to pay for your reasonable living expenses for the rest of your life. [6](#citations)

## Working Capital
>Working capital is a measure of both a company's efficiency and its short-term financial health. Working capital is calculated as: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. [7](#citations)  
I need to write up more about this.

## Efficient Frontier
>The efficient frontier (or portfolio frontier) is a concept in modern portfolio theory introduced by Harry Markowitz and others in 1952. It is the set of portfolios each with the feature that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same standard deviation of return. [8](#citations)  

This can send you down the rabbit hole of [Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) and [Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp). Something you should do eventually, when you have a lot of time.
