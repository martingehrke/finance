# Security

It is very important that you keep your money safe. But hiding it in a matress means no compounding interest. That means it really isn't cold hard cash but 1's and 0's on someone's electronic ledger. Here are some ways to ensure you keep your money yours.

## Passwords & Password Vaults

The most common passwords are "123456" and "password." Pathetic. [Lifehacker posts regularly about the most common passwords.](http://lifehacker.com/the-top-10-usernames-and-passwords-hackers-try-to-get-i-1762638243) Really the best solution is to not use easily rememberable passwords, but ones that are really hard to remember and have nothing to do with you personally. To do this you need to use a Password Vault.

* [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) (has an android client!)
* [1Password](https://1password.com/)
* [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/)
* [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)

I used LastPass until they, themselves, had a security breach! You can read up on their differences etc here (again) at Lifehacker: [Five Best Password Managers](http://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers).

## Two Factor Authentication
>Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA or 2-Step Verification) is a technology that provides identification of users by means of the combination of two different components. These components may be something that the user knows, something that the user possesses or something that is inseparable from the user. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication)  

I absolutely set this up for every account that allows it. Usually it means you have a put in your username and password (that you got from your password manager) and it will text or email you a code that expires. You put that in and voila! 

The big CON from this is that finance aggregation sites like mint.com don't always work with 2FA. I would prefer security over convenience. 

## Counter-espionage 

Sites often use a security question in case you need to reset your password. "Your mother's maiden name" is a common one. But this type of information can be trivial to get. Nothing says you can't use the wrong answer to these questions. So if a malicious party actually does know your mother's maiden name, it does them no good. Just make sure you remember your false answer (by noting it down in your password manager).
